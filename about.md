I am a confident, creative individual with strong problem-solving skills. I am an excellent communicator who is quick to learn and really enjoys being part of and leading teams.

My experience covers the full lifecycle of software development, deployment and support for enterprise software. I have worked across a range of roles including tech lead, senior engineer and business analyst.

### More Information

In my downtime, I try to get out as much as I can. That might be running, yoga, squash or chasing after my toddler! I also practice mindfulness meditation as often as I can. I cook A LOT taking a keen interest in nutrition and the origin of the food we eat. I love to travel and have been very fortunate to visit some incredible places in the world. I have volunteered at various charities over the years including a camp for severely disabled kids (PHAB) and a Sunday sports club for kids with learning difficulties (Hands On, London) and the preparation and distribution of food for homeless people in London and Oxford. Since moving to Kingston in 2019, I have been volunteering at the homeless shelters run by KCAH.
