## Other interests
I am very active; enjoying yoga, squash, running among other sports. I also practice mindfulness meditation as often as I can. I cook every day taking a keen interest in nutrition and the origin of the food we eat. I love to travel and have been very fortunate to visit some incredible places in the world. I have volunteered at various charities over the years including a camp for severely disabled kids (PHAB) and a Sunday sports club for kids with learning difficulties (Hands On, London) and the preparation and distribution of food for homeless people in London and Oxford. Since moving to Kingston in 2019, I have been volunteering at the homeless shelters run by KCAH.
